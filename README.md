Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to:

Explain the concepts of RISC and CISC computer architecture, emphasizing RISC.
Explain the elements of an instruction cycle.
Summarize the instruction cycle.
Write programs in assembly language using the AVR RISC architecture as a case study.
Write small programs in the C language, using C as a cross compiler from a higher level language to an assembly language.
Describe the function of compilers, linkers, loaders, and static and dynamic libraries
Use the techniques of polling and interrupts to obtain input from peripheral devices
Describe the characteristics of computer memory hierarchy systems, including performance issues of multiple memory levels
Describe the concepts of cache and virtual memory
Distinguish between memory mapping techniques
Explain how instruction pipelining speeds up over program execution, including describing various pipeline hazards.
Compare and contrast the various processors and architectures defined in the current literature
